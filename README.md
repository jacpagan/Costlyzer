## 1. Introduction
### Purpose
Costlyzer is designed to provide detailed financial and cost analysis for businesses, particularly focusing on unit economics and profitability metrics.

### Scope
The application is industry-agnostic and aims to solve business problems related to cost-efficiency and profitability.

---

## 2. Architecture
### Technical Stack
- Python (Backend Calculations)
- Libraries Used:
  - NumPy for numerical operations

### Modules
- `ItemCostCalculator`: Responsible for calculating the cost related to each item.
- `ProfitabilityAnalysis`: Provides financial metrics and profitability visualizations.

---

## 3. Prerequisites
### Environment Setup
- Python 3.x
- Required Packages:
  - NumPy

---

## 4. Codebase Explanation

### Initialization and Execution Logic
```python
# Main Execution
item_cost_calculator = ItemCostCalculator()  # Initializes the ItemCostCalculator class.
```
**Note**: Use `add_item` method to add individual items along with their costs and quantities.

### Profitability Analysis
```python
profitability_analysis = ProfitabilityAnalysis(item_cost_calculator, fixed_overheads)  # Initializes the ProfitabilityAnalysis class.
```
**Note**: Methods like `calculate_unit_costs` and `calculate_breakeven_point` belong to this class and serve specific financial analysis functions.

### Visualization
`profitability_analysis.plot_profit_analysis(sale_price_per_item)` generates a plot for profitability metrics.

## 5. Financial Metrics

This section outlines the different financial metrics that Costlyzer calculates. Each metric is followed by its respective formula, along with a brief explanation.

### Breakeven Units
- **Formula**: $ \frac {\text{Fixed Costs}}{(\text{Sale Price} - \text{Variable Cost per Unit})} $
- **Explanation**: The number of units that must be sold to cover all fixed and variable costs, reaching a net profit of zero.

### Breakeven Revenue
- **Formula**: $ \text{Breakeven Units} \times \text{Sale Price} $
- **Explanation**: The amount of revenue required to reach the breakeven point.

### Units Required for Target Profit
- **Formula**: $ \frac {\text{Target Net Profit}}{\text{Net Profit per Unit}} $
- **Explanation**: The number of units required to be sold to achieve the specified target net profit.

### Gross Profit Margin
- **Formula**: $ \frac {\text{Gross Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 $
- **Explanation**: Indicates what percentage of the total revenue is profit before accounting for operating expenses.

### Net Profit Margin
- **Formula**: $ \frac {\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 $
- **Explanation**: Shows the percentage of revenue remaining after all operating expenses, taxes, and additional income and expenses are accounted for.

### Return on Investment (ROI)
- **Formula**: $ \frac {\text{Net Profit}}{\text{Investment}} \times 100 $
- **Explanation**: Measures the profitability of an investment, represented as a percentage of the initial capital outlay.

### Operating Margin
- **Formula**: $ \frac {\text{Operating Income}}{\text{Revenue}} \times 100 $
- **Explanation**: Indicates how much of the revenue is left over after both the cost of goods sold and operating expenses have been accounted for.

### Revenue Growth Rate
- **Formula**: $ \frac {(\text{Current Revenue} - \text{Previous Revenue})}{\text{Previous Revenue}} \times 100 $
- **Explanation**: Measures the increase in revenue over a specific time period as a percentage of the revenue from the prior period.

## 6. Remarks
### Best Practices
Ensure code is compliant with PEP 8 standards for Python.

### Version History
Maintain a changelog for updates to calculations or added features.

---

## 7. Calculations Validation

- Methodology for each financial metric should be validated using real-world data for accuracy.
